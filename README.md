# Metaheuristics

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and comparisons of various metaheuristic algorithms
for solving CSRV problems.
Overview

The main file, src/main.rs, defines and runs several metaheuristic algorithms including:

- Simulated Annealing
- Tabu Search
- Evolutionary Algorithms
- TSSA (Tabu Search Simulated Annealing)
- Evolutionary Algorithm with Simulated Annealing Roullette Selection

These algorithms are configured to solve specific problem instances,
and the results are logged into .csv files and analyzed.

This repository also contains .ipynb files
(jupyter notebook files) with results in comparison
to greedy and random algorithms.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the main file:

```bash
cargo run
```
